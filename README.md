## Date Input Plugin for Apache Cordova

Cordova plugin to enhance text date inputs with native date selection.

## 1 step install

```
cordova plugin add https://github.com/leecrossley/cordova-plugin-date-input.git
```

## Usage

You **do not** need to reference any JavaScript, the Cordova plugin architecture will add a dateinput object to your root automatically when you build.

Ensure you use the plugin after your deviceready event has been fired.


## Platforms

This is currently a WIP for iOS, but the aim of this plugin is to provide a common interface for iOS, Android and Windows Phone 8.
